Docker - Hype or The Future?
============================

-----

My name is Alex
---------------
I'm Ruby dev
------------
I've been working with Docker for a while
-----------------------------------------

-----


Docker Experience
=================
* 5 Years Experience with Docker Swarm
* 8 Years with Kubernates
* 10 Years with Docker on production
* Everything on local machine works from separate Docker container.
* Everyday reading about new Docker features and related articles at least for 3 hours

.. note::

    Everything is (ruby, rails, db, redis, elastic, sphinx, vim, less, cat, echo)

-----

All this not about me
---------------------

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
===========

My Docker Experience
============================

* I run a few containers on prod
* I use Docker sometimes for development too

.. note::

    I run a few containers on prod. - Some of them already dead :( Not b/c of Docker for sure

    I use Docker sometimes for development: it reduce time needed to install and configure soft deps on a project.

A Story

.. note::

    A friend called me yesterday and said:
    > I've just installed. Seems like it cool! Everything works fine but...
    > I have a question: for what(why?) should I use it?"
    And I got I need some time to think about it actually...

.. note::

    not when like this

-----

.. image:: images/complex.png

.. note::

    maybe it's time to use Docker

-----

How did we live without Docker?

.. note:: 
    * [Dev] 2 projects with 1 overlay dependency
    * [Dev] Software upgrade on project (mysql 5.5 => 5.7)
    * [Dev] Set up environment for new developer
    * [Prod] (but talk about flicky bugs)DBA/Sysadmin(?) made hotfix on production
    * [Prod] (not all projects on AWS; last time not all believe even AWS) migrate to another hosting
    * [Prod] (issues can happen on deploying process: bundler or smth isn't achievable) can help to harden deploy process: you only would need to change DNS

comes to the resque!
====================

.. note::
    * you can run the different versions of a service on the same machine on different ports
    * you can easily switch between different version of a specific software
    * you can describe env settings once and use 1 command for setting up new instance of project on another machine
    * you won't get difference between staging and production if both of them run from the same image
    * you won't be dependent on your cloud provider once you set up Docker for prod
    * you can deploy only what you double checked on a server near

-----

What we are going to do with it?
================================

-----

Time to learn!!!
================

-----

What are we planning to cover?
==============================

* Install Docker
* Understand how it works
* Create a container
* Create an image
* Write your own Dockerfile

.. note::
    Overall: we'll play with docker. Now let's try to guess what service we'll use?
